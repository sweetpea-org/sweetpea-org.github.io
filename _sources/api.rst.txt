SweetPea API Documentation
==========================

This is the technical documentation for the :mod:`sweetpea` Python package,
which provides the implementation of the :ref:`SweetPea language <home>`.


.. NOTE: We start at api/sweetpea instead of _apidoc/modules because we only
   provide a single module, so having a higher-level organizational page isn't
   very helpful.

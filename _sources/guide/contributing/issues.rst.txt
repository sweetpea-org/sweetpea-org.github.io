Using the GitHub Issue Tracker
==============================

You can file bugs, make feature requests, or ask for help if something doesn't
seem to be working right by using the dedicated `GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/sweetpea-org/sweetpea-py/issues>`_ and clicking the ``New
issue`` button on the right. We use the following issue labels, which can be
assigned by clicking the ``Labels`` button on the right when submitting a new
issue:

- ``bug`` for when the code doesn't seem to be working correctly.
- ``enhancement`` for new feature requests
- ``question`` to ask for clarification or support in using SweetPea
